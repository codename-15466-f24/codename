As you check the mirror, you realize your face isn't yours.It's, someone else, someone more bloated, puffy, crusty.Who is that? Who am I?You try to forget about it and get ready for the morning.You brush your teeth, wash your face, and put your hair up. Accidentally sneaking a peek at the mirror again, you realize your faces looks more normal again.Guess it was a misunderstanding? Were you just tired?You feel more energized.₽Exit to the Hall₼hall.txt₽Keep examining the mirror₼mirror2.txt..
